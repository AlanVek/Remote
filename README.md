To enter text, the user must write it in the text-input slot and
press "Send".

To use hotkeys (ctrl), the user must write the second key in the
text-input slot and press the special key.

Objective: ctrl+v

Steps: Write 'v' (or 'V') and press 'ctrl'.
****************************************************************
For special keys (except ctrl), all the text written in the
text-input slot will be written to the computer before pressing
said key.

Example: 

Objective: 'Hello' + enter

Steps: Write 'Hello' and press 'Enter'.
